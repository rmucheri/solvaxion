# solvaxion-web

Installation
We need a couple of applications to run the Solvation Web to our local:

Node.js:

Check NodeJs Version:

Open the Terminal :

Run: node -v or node --version

If you get the version then the installation of NodeJs is done, 

$ node --version
$ v14.18.1
 
Make sure that you are running version v14.18.1 
 
if not use the following commands to check and install correct version :
 
node -- version (checks node version) 
 
if not v14.18.1 run the following command, 
 
nvm install v14.18.1 after installation run, 
 
nvm use v14.18.1
 

React Packages Install:

To install SOLVATIONWEB , you have to install React then go to the theme root directory where package.json located. Now install packages using 

npm install

it will install the packages. Make sure that there is no error.
